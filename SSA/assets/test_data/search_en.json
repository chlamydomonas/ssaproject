            "appDescription": "The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its derivational source, the Greek letter epsilon, 'Ε'. In etymology, the Semitic hê  has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented /h/ (and /e/ in foreign words), in Greek hê became epsilon with the value /e/. Etruscans and Romans followed this usage. Although Middle English spelling used 'e' to represent long and short /e/, the Great Vowel Shift changed long /eː/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iː/ while short /e/ (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a mid vowel.",
            "appManual": "In English orthography, e can represent the 'short e' sound /ɛ/, the 'long e' sound /iː/ or be silent when word-final, with a 'lengthening' effect on previous vowels (for example rat has a short vowel and rate has a long one). Some of the digraphs it occurs in are ee, ea, eu/ew, ei/ey, i.e., ui. In loanwords, 'e' or 'é' can represent the sound /eɪ/ as in 'café'.",

See the letter y for details.\nDuring the late Middle Ages, two forms of 'v' developed, which were both used for its ancestor 'u' and modern 'v'. The pointed form 'v' was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valor' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon'. The first distinction between the letters 'u' and 'v' is recorded in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. Printers eschewed capital 'U' into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762.[3]",

As an English vowel letter, it has a 'long' and 'short' pronunciation that are used in different contexts. Short 'u', found in closed syllables, commonly represents /ʌ/ (as in 'duck') or /ʊ/ (as in 'put'). Long 'u' commonly represents /juː/ ('long U' as in 'mule') or /uː/ (as in 'blue').",

            "appDescription": "In Latin, Y was named Y Graeca 'Greek Y'. This was pronounced as I Graeca 'Greek I', since the classical Greek sound /y/, similar to modern German ü or French u, was not a native sound for Latin speakers, and the letter was initially only used to spell foreign words. In Romance languages, this history has led to the standard modern name of the letter: In Spanish, Y is called i griega, in Galician i grego, in Catalan i grega, in French and Romanian i grec - all meaning 'Greek i'. The names igrek in Polish and i gờ-rét in Vietnamese are both phonetic borrowings of the French name. In Dutch, both Griekse ij and i-grec are used. The original Greek name upsilon has also been adapted into several modern languages; in German, for example, it is called Ypsilon, and in Italian the name is ípsilon or ípsilo. In Portuguese, both names are used (ípsilon and i grego). [1]",
            "appManual": "The oldest direct ancestor of English letter Y was the Semitic letter waw, from which also come F, U, V, and W. See F for details. The Greek and Latin alphabets developed from the Phoenician form of this early alphabet.
