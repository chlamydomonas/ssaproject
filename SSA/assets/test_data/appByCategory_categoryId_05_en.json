            "appDescription": "One of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English 〈J〉, because the Egyptian word for 'snake' was djet. It is speculated by many that Semitic people working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for 'snake' may have begun with that sound. However, the name for the letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic alphabets is nun, which means 'fish' in some of these languages. The sound value of the letter was /n/—as in Greek, Etruscan, Latin and modern languages.",
            "appManual": "N represents a dental or alveolar nasal in virtually all languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the International Phonetic Alphabet. A common digraph with 'n' is 'ng', which represents a velar nasal in a variety of languages, usually positioned word-finally in English. Often, before a velar plosive (as in ink or jungle), 'n' alone represents a velar nasal. In Italian and French, 'gn' represents a palatal nasal /ɲ/. The Portuguese and Vietnamese spelling for this sound is 'nh', while Spanish and a few other languages use the letter 'ñ'. In English, 'n' is generally silent when it is preceded by an 'm' at the end of words, as in hymn; however, 'n' is pronounced in this combination when occurring word medially, as in hymnal.",

            "appDescription": "Its graphic form has remained fairly constant from Phoenician times until today. The name of the Phoenician letter was ʿeyn, meaning 'eye', and indeed its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyph, c.f. Proto-Sinaitic script). Its original sound value was that of a consonant, probably [ʕ], the sound represented by the cognate Arabic letter letter ع ʿayn.",
            "appManual": "The letter O is the fourth most common letter in the English alphabet.[2] Like the other English vowel letters, it has associated 'long' and 'short' pronunciations. The 'long o' as in boat is actually most often a diphthong /oʊ/ (realized dialectically anywhere from [o] to [əʊ]). In English there is also a 'short O' as in fox, /ɒ/, which sounds slightly different in different dialects. In most dialects of British English, it is either an open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔ] or an open back rounded vowel [ɒ]; in American English, it is most commonly an unrounded back to a central vowel [ɑ] to [a].",

            "appDescription": "The Semitic sound value of Qôp (perhaps originally qaw, 'cord of wool', and possibly based on an Egyptian hieroglyph) was /q/ (voiceless uvular stop), a sound common to Semitic languages, but not found in English or most[citation needed] Indo-European ones. In Greek, this sign as Qoppa Ϙ probably came to represent several labialized velar stops, among them /kʷ/ and /kʷʰ/. As a result of later sound shifts, these sounds in Greek changed to /p/ and /pʰ/ respectively. Therefore, Qoppa was transformed into two letters: Qoppa, which stood for a number only, and Phi Φ which stood for the aspirated sound /pʰ/ that came to be pronounced /f/ in Modern Greek.",
            "appManual": "In most European languages written in the Latin script, such as in Romance and Germanic languages, 'q' appears almost exclusively in the digraph 'qu'. Notable exceptions to this are Albanian, in which 'q' represents the voiceless palatal stop [c]; and Maltese and Võro, which use 'q' to represent the glottal stop [ʔ]. In French, Occitan, Catalan and Portuguese, 'qu' represents /k/ or /kw/; in Spanish, it represents /k/. 'qu' replaces 'c' for /k/ before front vowels 'i' and 'e', since in those languages 'c' represents a fricative or affricate before front vowels. In Italian 'qu' represents [kw] (where [w] is the semivowel allophone of /u/).",
