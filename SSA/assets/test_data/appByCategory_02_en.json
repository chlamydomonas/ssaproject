In Fijian it represents a prenasalized stop /nd/.[2] In some languages where voiceless unaspirated stops contrast with voiceless aspirated stops, 'd' represents an unaspirated /t/, while 't' represents an aspirated /tʰ/.

            "appDescription": "The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its derivational source, the Greek letter epsilon, 'Ε'. In etymology, the Semitic hê  has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented /h/ (and /e/ in foreign words), in Greek hê became epsilon with the value /e/. Etruscans and Romans followed this usage. Although Middle English spelling used 'e' to represent long and short /e/, the Great Vowel Shift changed long /eː/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iː/ while short /e/ (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a mid vowel.",
            "appManual": "In English orthography, e can represent the 'short e' sound /ɛ/, the 'long e' sound /iː/ or be silent when word-final, with a 'lengthening' effect on previous vowels (for example rat has a short vowel and rate has a long one). Some of the digraphs it occurs in are ee, ea, eu/ew, ei/ey, i.e., ui. In loanwords, 'e' or 'é' can represent the sound /eɪ/ as in 'café'.",
