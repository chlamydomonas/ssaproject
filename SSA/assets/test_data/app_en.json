The first English language book to make a clear distinction between 'i' and 'j' was published in 1633.[6] In loan words such as raj, 'J' may be pronounced /ʒ/ by some speakers. In some of these, including raj, Taj Mahal, and Beijing, the regular pronunciation /dʒ/ is actually closer to the foreign pronunciation, making this an instance of a hyperforeignism.[7] Occasionally 'J' represents the original /j/ sound, as in Hallelujah and fjord (see: yodh for details).

﻿  ﻿  "appDescription":"The Semitic sound value of Qôp (perhaps originally qaw, 'cord of wool', and possibly based on an Egyptian hieroglyph) was /q/ (voiceless uvular stop), a sound common to Semitic languages, but not found in English or most[citation needed] Indo-European ones. In Greek, this sign as Qoppa Ϙ probably came to represent several labialized velar stops, among them /kʷ/ and /kʷʰ/. As a result of later sound shifts, these sounds in Greek changed to /p/ and /pʰ/ respectively. Therefore, Qoppa was transformed into two letters: Qoppa, which stood for a number only, and Phi Φ which stood for the aspirated sound /pʰ/ that came to be pronounced /f/ in Modern Greek.",﻿  ﻿  
﻿  ﻿  "appManual":"In most European languages written in the Latin script, such as in Romance and Germanic languages, 'q' appears almost exclusively in the digraph 'qu'. Notable exceptions to this are Albanian, in which 'q' represents the voiceless palatal stop [c]; and Maltese and Võro, which use 'q' to represent the glottal stop [ʔ]. In French, Occitan, Catalan and Portuguese, 'qu' represents /k/ or /kw/; in Spanish, it represents /k/. 'qu' replaces 'c' for /k/ before front vowels 'i' and 'e', since in those languages 'c' represents a fricative or affricate before front vowels. In Italian 'qu' represents [kw] (where [w] is the semivowel allophone of /u/).",

See the letter y for details.\nDuring the late Middle Ages, two forms of 'v' developed, which were both used for its ancestor 'u' and modern 'v'. The pointed form 'v' was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valor' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon'. The first distinction between the letters 'u' and 'v' is recorded in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. Printers eschewed capital 'U' into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762.[3]",

English uses W to represent /w/, German, Polish and Kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ (with Polish and related Kashubian using Ł for /w/), and Dutch uses it for /w/ or /ʋ/. Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used in Welsh and Cornish to represent the vowel /u/ as well as the related approximant consonant /w/. English also contains a number of words beginning with a W that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) R, remaining from usage in Anglo-Saxon in which the W was pronounced: wreak, wrap, wreck, wrench, wroth, wrinkle, etc. (Certain dialects of Scottish English still distinguish this digraph.)",

﻿  ﻿  "appDescription":"In Ancient Greek, 'Χ' and 'Ψ' were among several variants of the same letter, used originally for /kʰ/ and later, in western areas such as Arcadia, as a simplification of the digraph 'ΧΣ' for /ks/. In the end, more conservative eastern forms became the standard of Classical Greek, and thus 'Χ' (Chi) stands for /kʰ/ (later /x/). However, the Etruscans had taken over 'Χ' from western Greek, and it therefore stands for /ks/ in Etruscan and Latin.[citation needed]",
﻿  ﻿  "appManual":"In English orthography, x is typically pronounced as the voiceless consonant cluster /ks/ when it follows the stressed vowel, and the voiced consonant /ɡz/ when it precedes the stressed vowel (e.g. 'exam'), or when it precedes a silent 'h' and an accented vowel ('exhaust').[2] Before 'i' or 'u' it can also be pronounced /kʃ/ or /ɡʒ/ for example, in the words 'sexual' and 'luxury', respectively: these result from earlier /ksj/ and /ɡzj/. It also makes the sound /kʃ/ in words ending in -xion (typically used only in British-based spellings of the language; American spellings tend to use -ction).

This was pronounced as I Graeca 'Greek I', since the classical Greek sound /y/, similar to modern German ü or French u, was not a native sound for Latin speakers, and the letter was initially only used to spell foreign words. In Romance languages, this history has led to the standard modern name of the letter: In Spanish, Y is called i griega, in Galician i grego, in Catalan i grega, in French and Romanian i grec - all meaning 'Greek i'. The names igrek in Polish and i gờ-rét in Vietnamese are both phonetic borrowings of the French name. In Dutch, both Griekse ij and i-grec are used. The original Greek name upsilon has also been adapted into several modern languages; in German, for example, it is called Ypsilon, and in Italian the name is ípsilon or ípsilo. In Portuguese, both names are used (ípsilon and i grego). [1]",
